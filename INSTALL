POInT 1.61 installation instructions:

Dependancies:
The stand-only version of POInT comes with copies of the LAPACK and BLAS linear algebra libraries, a random number generator and the f2c libraries, which the key dependancies. (If you have local copies of LAPACK and BLAS, the configure script should find these and use them in preference to the "shipped" copies.)  If you want plotting capacity, you will need the plotutils package (https://www.gnu.org/software/plotutils/). If you want the web server as well, you will also need:
- imagemagick (https://imagemagick.org)
- the BOOST libraries
- the GNU cgi library (https://www.gnu.org/software/cgicc/index.html)

On UBUNTU systems, you can obtain all of these with
% sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
% sudo apt-get install libcgicc-dev
% sudo apt install -y imagemagick
% sudo apt-get install plotutils-dev
% sudo apt-get install plotutils


Basic Instructions:
The following 4 commands should generate the four POInT executables (POInT, POInt_genome_scaffold POInT_ances_order and POInT_simulate)  from POInT.tar--
the % indicates your prompt--don't type it :)


Type
% tar xvf POInT.tar

Now, you will need to make the package.  

*****BUILDING POInT******
The previous command will create a new directory called POInT. Enter that directory
% cd POInT

Now the configure script will make some simple checks of your OS and build the files needed for compiling POInT
%./configure.pl

You can now make all of the needed programs by typing
% make



Options from the configure script:
- If you have install the Gnu Plotutils package and would like to use it for illustrations with POInT, use
%./configure.pl -p:<PATH TO libplot> 

- If you want to compile the OpenMP parallel version of POInT, use
%./configure.pl -omp

- If you have the plot utilities AND the BOOST, CGI and imagemagick libraries installed, using
%./configure.pl  -p:<PATH TO libplot>  -browser
will cause make to also build POInT_daemon, POInT_browse and POInT_download, allowing you to configure a POInT web server.


Please see the included POInT documentation (POInT.html) for instructions and tips on using POInT. Instructions for the POInT browser are online at

Comments on basic installation process:

To build and use the package, you will need a c and a c++ compiler (preferably the GNu gcc and g++). The make command will build liblapack 
(a partial lapack library), libf2c (because lapack was originally built in Fortran), a random number generation library (libranlib) and POInT. 
  
The configure.pl script will check the standard locations to see if your system already has the lapack and blas linear algebra libraries installed (/usr/lib/, /usr/local/lib and /lib).  If the libraries are detected, they will be used for the installation: otherwise the script will invoke the compilation of the included copy of the necessary parts of lapack and the f2c routines needed to use it.


Other platforms:
This package was developed and tested using Mac OX 10.13 and Ubuntu Linux with the clang and gcc compilers.  It should work on 
other platforms but has not been tested on them.
